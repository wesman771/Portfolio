<h2 class= "text-centered"> About Me</h2>
<p>   My name is Wesley Dangerfield, after studying elctrical engineering in college for about 2 years I realized that I was in the wrong field!!
i switched to learning cyber security but soon realized that i preffered the web development side of things more than the security side.</p> 
<p> As a Thinkful student, i've begun my software development journey and have every moment of it</p>
<p> If your looking to hire a web developer please reach out!! I'm so excited to work with other developers and create great software and web projects!!
